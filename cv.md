## About

I'm motivated, self-disciplined with strong communication skills. I am mostly efficient when I have a clear goal kept in mind.

I've worked for a long period of time in two international companies which has given me a solid foundation to build upon in terms of team work, flexibility and setting priorities.But I realized that it’s not the career path that I’d like to continue. So, I decided to switch careers and become a software engineer. Currently, I'm taking a Front-End developer course at [Rolling Scopes School](https://rs.school/).
