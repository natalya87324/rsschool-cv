## About

I'm motivated, self-disciplined with strong communication skills. I am mostly efficient when I have a clear goal kept in mind.

I've worked for a long period of time in two international companies which has given me a solid foundation to build upon in terms of team work, flexibility and setting priorities.But I realized that it’s not the career path that I’d like to continue. So, I decided to switch careers and become a software engineer. Currently, I'm taking a Front-End developer course at [Rolling Scopes School](https://rs.school/).

## Code example

**Udemy "JS challenges" by Brad Traversy** <br> **_Instruction:_** Write a function called `reverseString` that takes in a string and returns the reversed version of the string. Be sure to use recursion in your solution.

```JS

function reverseString(str) {
  if (str === '') {
    return '';
  }
  reverseString(str.slice(1));
  return reverseString(str.slice(1)) + str[0];
}
```
